- better "@" and "#;" handlink, #l8r

- add link to output_file-TIMESTAMP into archive_file; #l8r
- add priority, something like "#project_2***" [but triple asterisk doesn't survive markdown]
- add separate files for each name and project, w/ prev|actv|nxt navigation; #l8r
- accept multiple input files to allow users to edit their own .md files; #l8r
- add section header parsing to apply "#project"" to all following tasks until "\n\n" or another heading
- add project definitions, ex: "#project_1"": i'm just fucking with you, don't do these things. they're just to test the parser." and display as a paragraph under the project heading in by-projects
